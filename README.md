# XSControl Library

Welcome to the XSControl Library, developed by The XSpace Academy, designed to facilitate advanced control techniques for embedded systems. This library enables the implementation of various control algorithms and signal processing methods with ease, especially tailored for projects using ESP32.

## Features

- **Control Algorithms**: Includes implementations for PID control and other control strategies to manage your system's dynamics.
- **Signal Filtering**: Offers First and Second Order Low Pass Filters for effective signal smoothing and noise reduction.
- **Designed for ESP32**: Optimized for use with ESP32 microcontrollers, compatible with Arduino IDE and PlatformIO.


## Installation

### PlatformIO

To use `XSControl` with PlatformIO, add the following line to your `platformio.ini` file under the `lib_deps` section:

```ini
lib_deps =
 https://github.com/TheXSpaceAcademy/XSControl.git#main
```

### Arduino IDE

For Arduino IDE, you can clone this repository and place it in your Arduino libraries folder, or you can download the zip and import it directly into the Arduino IDE.
